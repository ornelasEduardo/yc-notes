## Ideas are Worthless
- People overvalue ideas and that's why they think that coming up with an idea is hard.
- Startup ideas are worthless.
- The initial idea is just a starting point, most startups don't end up like their initial idea.

## Your Idea is not a Blueprint
- Treat the idea like a question. If you treat it as an assertion, then it can be wrong.
  - **Example:** Instead of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet?

- If you treat your idea as a problem, you can also identify smaller problems within it.
  - **Ask:** Is there some way to bite off some subset of the problem, then gradually expand from there?


## The Environment for Ideas
- There are two things needed to generate idea questions:
  1. To be familiar with promising new technologies.
  2. To have the right kind of friends.

- The right environment for having startup ideas is a situation with a large percentage of time spent working on new stuff ('school').
- You need to have people to bounce your ideas off of. YC doesn't fund startups with one founder.
  - It's good to have friends.

## Letting Your Mind Wander
- The together-alone-together sandwich: 
  1. Talk about a hard problem with your cofounders
  2. Think about the problem alone in the shower.
  3. As you shower thoughts come to you, go back and talk about them with your cofounders.
- Let your ideas have sex - combine ideas from separate disciplines or areas of your mind and see what happens.
- New ideas arise like doodles - they don't happen as a result of directly focusing on something, but often as the result of letting your mind escape.

## The Recipe for Startup Ideas
- Don't have unprotected idea sex - Don't start with randomness. Start with a problem, then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.
- The recipe:
  1. Finding the problem intolerable.
  2. Feeling it must be (pragmatically) possible to solve it (by you in your lifetime [given that you have an average human lifespan]).


## Make something people want.
- Wealth is what people want.
- Good ideas and valuable ideas aren't always the same thing.
  - **Ask:** Will people actually pay for this?

## How to make something people want
- Look at stuff people use now that's broken.
- Take a luxury and make it into a commmodity.
- Look at 

## Redefining the Problem
- Solve the problem people care about most, don't focus on the options.
  - **Example:** Model T and Henry Ford
- Make things easier.
- Make things easier to use.
  - Be able to say "it just works" on the technology.
  - **Example:** Knobs on a stove.

## Design for Exit
- Success for a startup means getting bought. 
- Look at big companies and think about what they should be doing and do it faster.
- Make something multiple acquirers will want.

## Build for Yourself
- The most productive way to generate startup ideas is by accident.
- The best way to generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up amusing hacks with your friends.
