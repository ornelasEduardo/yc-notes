Paul Graham and team divide their funding applications into three categories:
  1. Promising
  2. Unpromising
  3. Promising people with unpromising ideas



#### Are people interested?
- It's common for founders to build a lame product before realizing the they have to build a something which people will pay for.
  - **Example:** Artix
- Determine whether potential customers are actually interested in buying the product.
  - **Example:** Making websites for art galleries.

#### Think (A little) Before You Act
- It's wise to consider multiple ideas and to spend a few days thinking on them rather than going with the first idea.
  - **Example:** Arrange the painting before the first stroke.
- Plunging into an idea is a good thing. 
- Investing time in something doesn't make it good.
  - **Example:** Viaweb vs. Webgen

#### Where There's Muck, There's Brass
- The purpose of a company is to make money.
- Don't get caught up in being cool. The main goal should always be making money.
- Unsexy stuff is often valuable.

#### Don't Be Shy
- Don't be timid to compete against bigger companies.
- Business isn't something to be afraid of.

#### Choose Your Problems
- **Ask:** Of all the things we could do, is this the one with the best chance of making money?
- Chosing problems is something that can be learned.
- You don't need business people, hackers can listen to customers too.
- The essence of startups is having brilliant people doing work that's beneath them.
- **Read:** How to Win Friends and Influence People
- Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution.



**Make something people want.**
