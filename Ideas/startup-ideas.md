- Look for problems.
- The best startups have three things in common: 
  1. They're something the founders themselves want
  2. They themselves can build.
  3. Few others realize are worth doing.

## Work on a Problem That's Real
- It's important to work on a problem that you have because it means that it's real.
- People thinking too much about ideas can get caught up in solving problems that dont' exist.
  - **Example:** Sitcom Startup Ideas


## Your Initial Users
- When you first launch, there have to be some users who need what is made urgently.
- Don't make something that a lot of people need mildly, build something that a small amount of people need strongly.
  - **Example:** Dig a well not a broad hole.
- **Ask:** Who want's this right now?
