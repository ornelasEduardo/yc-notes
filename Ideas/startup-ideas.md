- Look for problems.
- The best startups have three things in common: 
  1. They're something the founders themselves want
  2. They themselves can build.
  3. Few others realize are worth doing.

## Work on a Problem That's Real
- It's important to work on a problem that you have because it means that it's real.
- People thinking too much about ideas can get caught up in solving problems that dont' exist.
  - **Example:** Sitcom Startup Ideas


## Your Initial Users
- When you first launch, there have to be some users who need what is made urgently.
- Don't make something that a lot of people need mildly, build something that a small amount of people need strongly.
  - **Example:** Dig a well not a broad hole.
- **Ask:** Who want's this right now?


## Painting a Perfect Picture
- There isn't a formula to make good ideas. You have to set yourself up for success by surrounding yourself in the right environment and learning the skills that are necessary.
  - **Example:** Learning how to program.

## What's Missing?
- If you immerse yourself in the environment, start to notice what's 'missing'. 
- Try not to overthink it, sometime really simple things are just missing.
- **Action:** Work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing
## Build Toys 
- A toy has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter.

## Just Build Things
- Don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things. 

## Don't Worry About the Competition
- It's rare for startups to be killed by competitors.
- If you're too late, ask your users.
- Inexperienced founders give competitors more credit than what's really due.
- Crowded markets can be a good sign (high demand).
- Compete by having your secret weapon.

## Turn off the Schlep and Unsexy Filters
- It's okay to work on boring problems. In fact, it's encouraged.
